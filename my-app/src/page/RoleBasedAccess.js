                <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> is a security methodology that manages user access to resources based on their roles within an organization.
                Instead of granting permissions directly to individual users, RBAC assigns permissions to roles, and then users are assigned to one or more roles.
                This approach simplifies access management, enhances security by limiting access to the principle of least privilege, and improves auditability.
